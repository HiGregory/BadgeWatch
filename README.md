# Badge Watch Update | Aug 3, 2020

Where can you find police complaints in your local city or county? Often this data is compilled and shared in reports but 
it's hard for people to access. Many cities and counties like Miami have reports with information like this that if put into a simple
search tool could help people identify information.

Orginally a prototype concept, BadgeWatch is a badge search tool for local residents to find information related to police complaints.
